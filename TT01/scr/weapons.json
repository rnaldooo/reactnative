Let’s breakdown the nutritional facts here: Arquebex is a very high damage weapon for Voidrig, as it makes sense for his damage output kit. Bonewidow is our Melee Necramech more focused on survivability and endurance. Exalted Ironbride is not going to match 1:1 with Arquebex, but that doesn’t mean Ironbride (or the rest of her kit) should be overshadowed. The below aim to address common Community feedback to provide Bonewidow that extra dash of spice.\nRenamed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden ‘Shield Bash’ to ‘Maiden’s Kiss’.\nReduced Bonewidow’s Maiden’s Kiss to cost 15 Energy.  \nBonewidow’s Meathook thrown enemies now have 100% Status Chance.\nBonewidow’s Meathook now drains a percent of the target's max Health vs flat damage. When the target is thrown the Damage dealt is a percentage of the target's current Health.\nBoth of these changes help to scale Meathook with varying enemy levels.\nBonewidow Necramech can now reflect damage while blocking with Shield Maiden (this is exclusive to the player’s version of Bonewidow).\nBonewidow will now absorb enemy attacks for a few seconds after activating Shield Maiden, and the absorbed damage will be added to the shield’s Health.\nEnemy Bonewidow Shield Maiden now has a limited amount of Health and can be destroyed.\nEnemy Bonewidow will no longer reattach her arm while wielding Exalted Ironbride. One thing at a time! \nRemoved Ammo UI when Bonewidow is wielding Ironbride. \nFixed a crash when using Bonewidow’s Meathook on a Deimos Mitosid.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden not deactivating upon Transferring out/back in. This resulted in your shield being on your chest (not active). However, when you pressed Melee you would do Maiden’s Kiss, and it would cost Energy, instead of the normal Necramech unarmed attack.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line affecting Companions/Pets.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line ragdolling you.\nFixed enemy Bonewidow sometimes getting stuck with Ironbride out and being unable to switch back to its gun.\nFixed Bonewidow Melee attacking while using Shield Maiden (Maiden’s Kiss attack) would show Atlas' Landslide ability pop-up text.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line animation not matching its current shield state correctly. \nFixed Bonewidow’s rear hit box getting hit from front attacks.\nFixed Bonewidow visual-only \"Ability Use Prevented\" problem after toggling Shield Maiden and Ironbride off.\nFixed enemy Bonewidows not knowing how to initiate a Maiden’s Kiss. Pucker up! \nFixed enemy Bonewidows sometimes using incorrect idle animations that would cause their shield to look unequipped when it should be and/or their sword to be held incorrectly.\nFixed enemy Bonewidows periodically playing the Shield Maiden unequip animation during a Melee attack combo.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden not deactivating after redeploying/Transferring in and out but still bashing with Shield instead of normal Melee. This also fixes a related issue where Ironbride would only execute the first attack in its combo chain instead of the full loop. \nFixed an issue with Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden blocking bounds becoming very small when attacked. This was causing Bonewidow to take damage instead of the shield.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Meathook not properly skewering the target if done by a Client player. Previously the ragdoll would appear to float around.\nFixed enemies held by Bonewidow’s Meathook able to cast abilities.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Meathook not displaying \"Not Enough Energy\" UI message.\nFixed enemies on Bonewidows Meathook teleporting to their last known spot instead of just being dropped when activating Shield Maiden at the same time.\nEnemy Necramechs (Voidrig & Bonewidow) will now rotate its body to indicate that it is about to slide towards you. \nFixed cases where both Voidrig and Bonewidow wouldn’t attack with its currently equipped weapon.\nExtended context action range of the Bait console when grabbing the key during an Isolation Vault Bounty to help prevent sliding past it or standing on top of it.\nRunning out of Railjack Boost stamina will now clear the Boost state to address Boost not recharging once depleted. ","fixes":""},{"name":"Deimos: Arcana: Hotfix 29.5.6","date":"2020-12-01T22:31:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1238756-deimos-arcana-hotfix-2956/","additions":"","changes":"An important raised issue with Bonewidow is being unable to regenerate Health, as Bonewidow is geared towards the more “tankier” focused Necramech in comparison to Voidrig.

While it’s always ideal to stick together, we hope the 250 meter range allows you to both level up your Necramech faster and venture a bit farther in the landscape.\n*Necramechs (Bonewidow and Voidrig) now have a built-in vacuum!\nWith the introduction of the newest Bounties, we reviewed Obelisk spawn sites and saw that they were occupying vacant sites that we felt would be better used for new Bounty objectives!

It was not our intention to hide or subvert that information in game, and we should have clarified more quickly that this was the case.\nbut ultimately we are all hands on deck working to make Heart of Deimos the best it can be for August 25th. As of this Hotfix, any Tenno who have already walked The Steel Path will receive a Resource Drop Chance Booster.\nThis Hotfix ensures that Resource Drop Chance Boosters work within The Steel Path for Riven Slivers and Steel Essence. They were initially turned off to ensure the inherent Steel Path Resource Drop Chance Booster worked as intended. Like the initial Arcane Marketplace in Scarlet Spear, we wanted to ensure the automatic ‘100% Steel Path Resource Drop Chance Booster’ didn’t unintentionally scale for Resources specific to the Steel Path (Riven Slivers and Steel Essence).

We had fewer weapons, fewer Warframes, and way fewer Mods. As players continue their Forma journey, there’s often discussions on doing a Quality of Life (QOL) pass to the way things work with our favourite Golden Puzzle Piece.\nRight now, using a Forma on a Warframe (or Archwing/Necramech) requires you to start from 0 when it comes to Abilities you can use. Furthermore, you only get the first Rank of your First ability. Take Valkyr for instance. You install a Forma, and you’re back to only casting unranked Rip Line!\nSorties and Arbitrations now allow Mastery Rank 30+ players that have put at least 1 Forma into their Warframe to bypass the \"Rank 30 Warframe\" requirement.\nWarframe Decoration tools are all about customization. We value that quality. The learning curve for new players, however, can be pretty steep. Tools like Surface Snapping and Rotation Axis are ideal for ambitious decorators with particular visions for their Orbiters and Dojos, but they can overwhelm Tenno new to decorating.\nSitting in the Helminth chair with a Warframe you haven’t Subsumed yet will now move that option to the top of the list. ","fixes":"Coming November 16 for a limited time, we are launching Prime Resurgence!

For existing players, your chat settings remain untouched but the Q&A Channel has been enabled on login.\nMany Tenno may wonder what our larger goal is here. We have many motivations for these changes, but one of the strongest is the role Region chat plays our report systems. It may come as no surprise to hear that Region chat is home to the most reports of any channel in Warframe. These reports are reviewed and acted on by the staff here at Digital Extremes, and consequences have always been in place for offensive content. However, some consequences were not strict enough. We are aiming to reset the onboarding experience and chat experience in Warframe by including a new default Q&A channel to provide a dedicated place for players to bring Warframe knowledge to a chatroom in a designated place.\nWe also aim to clean up Region chat for members who like having a place to simply discuss Warframe. Region chat will be opt-in, and Offensive Language reports dealing with hate speech will have enforcement that is not up for appeal. If you find yourself under account restrictions due to Offensive Language, our stance is very clear here: We have no tolerance. https://digitalextremes.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043974052-Code-Of-Conduct-Respect-for-all-in-Warframe\nThe Rank Up FX for Warframes, Weapons, and Companions has been given a refresh!

Many players voiced that the Kuva Lich system got progressively less fun the more time and energy was devoted to it. While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nFixed Lich ‘Ruse’ clones displaying the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder instead of the same Warframe Helmet as their owner. \nThis fix needs some explanation. First of all, a bit of trivia, Railjack operates at a different scale than the rest of Warframe. Perhaps some of you have seen space-time breaking down in the form of truly enormous cats... The Speed that was being shown in the drydock in your ship Stats was in the wrong scale and gave numbers that were inaccurate.  This also caused the bonus given by your engine, displayed in kilometers-per-hour, to be wrong: an engine might say that it gave an extra 30km per hour, but give far far more than that in the Stats if you did the math to convert.  This has been fixed so that: 1) your Stats now show the correct Speed for Railjack's world scale, and, 2) your engines are rated in meters per second which matches up to the Stats.  While it may look like your ship's Speed stat in the drydock has gone down significantly, please try flying around in missions and see how your ship handles. This only fixes how the UI reports the numbers in your Stats. No change to how fast your ship actually moves is intended, and if your ship doesn't fly at the meters-per-second shown in the Stats then it should be carefully measured and reported as a bug.\nFixed the camera breaking when Warping to another player while in the Archwing Slingshot.","fixes":"Fixed fully default Look Links not applying to your Warframe. \nFixed several potential script errors caused by Warframe abilities.\nFixed numerous script errors when casting certain Warframe abilities."},{"name":"Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.12 + 27.0.12.1","date":"2020-01-23T15:36:07Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1163746-empyrean-ivara-prime-27012-270121/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixes towards pathing issues with the Drone in the Plains of Eidolon. This also fixes a very specific spot where the Drone would regularly get stuck.

And so it was, we burned heaps of midnight oil to launch The War Within and experience the roller coaster of feels with you all over again.\nWitnessing your reaction to THE SACRIFICE teaser we showed at TennoCon last year is an emotion we can’t quite put into words. We’re pretty sure you guys shook the convention center and the internet. So we’re absolutely ecstatic that you can now continue your journey as Tenno in the Warframe universe in this new quest.\nFrom all of us at Digital Extremes, thank you for sharing Warframe with us. This once small but growing studio in London, Ontario couldn’t have done any of this without your extraordinary support, Tenno.\nWe hope that you have enjoyed the ride so far. We look forward to seeing what Warframe has in store for all of us as we look toward the future.\nNow, a foreboding vision leads the Tenno to hunt for a savage Warframe.

Then came The War Within, where your Operator became playable with a few abilities meant mainly to help you earn Kuva and participate in Quests.\nThe core purpose of this rework is to shift the goals of the Focus system away from supplementing Warframes and towards making your Operator more combat-ready.

A game that lives up to the amazing community that has grown around it.\nTo create more flow with Transference between Operator and Warframe, you can now seamlessly transition to your Operator and back to your Warframe at any time \nWhen in Operator mode, Warframes now have a 90% damage reduction from enemies if an ability is active during Transference. If no ability is active during Transference, you Warframe is invulnerable and untargetable.\nOne of Warframe’s biggest appeals is the diverse selection of weaponry. Even within the subclasses of rifles and pistols, there is huge variety to be found, such as the distinction between projectile weapons (firing physical projectiles which move through space, like the Boltor) and hitscan weapons (firing draws an imaginary line between the gun and the point aimed at, doing damage instantly to whatever it hits, like the Soma). For obvious reasons, hitscans are very effective at long distances \nthis has never been an issue with Warframe’s tileset-based gameplay, but as we shot enemies from a kilometer away in the plains with our pistols, we knew something had to be done.\nThe in-game Market now includes a separate category for Warframe Deluxe Bundles! \nMade many small performance optimizations to all Warframe abilities.\nChanged Juggernaut's response to Warframe abilities to be consistent with other bosses.","fixes":"Fixed Mozi Syandana not displaying properly on some Warframes and Skins.\nFixed an issue with people being unable to trigger Transference during The War Within.\nFixed an issue in the final cutscene of The Second Dream quest where the Lotus and the Operator would disappear momentarily, giving players the ability to control their Warframe. \nFixed wonky Archwing transitions in the final tileset of The War Within quest.   \nFixed the Igaro Syandana positioning on all Warframes. \nFixed being able to zoom out on your Warframe when hitting ESC upon opening the Star Chart. \nFixed Synthula Alerts appearing in the World State Window before having unlocked the Kuva Fortress via The War Within quest\nFixed Warframe custom HUDs not properly changing if you switch from one Warframe with a custom HUD to another (e.g. Simulacrum arsenal).\nFixed Warframes holding their hand out to the left when jumping along walls to the right.

Perhaps Taxon will not replace the Mastery Rank 23 player's beloved Carrier, but please keep in mind that it was created and geared towards new-players who are experiencing Warframe for the first time.","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed unintentionally being able to use Warframe Abilities in the Mastery Rank 19 Test."},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.9.3","date":"2017-02-07T21:51:44Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/760078-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-1993/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed the Helminth Infirmary chair not curing your Warframe of the Cyst."},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.9.2 (Phase One: DB Upgrades)","date":"2017-02-07T13:58:54Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/759911-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-1992-phase-one-db-upgrades/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a rare case of players sometimes not unlocking the Focus system when completing The Second Dream, which resulted in progression stoppers during The War Within."},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.9.1","date":"2017-02-02T22:32:29Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/757913-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-1991/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Clients gaining invulnerability when using Transference from Warframe to Operator."},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Update 19.8.0","date":"2017-01-25T19:24:45Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/754548-the-glast-gambit-update-1980/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Warframe’s doing a rapid spin when backing out to the Arsenal from the Upgrade screen."},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.7.2","date":"2017-01-23T14:36:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/753669-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-1972/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Warframe abilities lasting forever if Transference is activated at the same time of cast. \nFixed Archwings and Warframes appearing to flicker as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/679337-archwing-disappears-while-using-afterburners/"},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.6.3","date":"2017-01-17T19:30:07Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/751177-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-1963/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed not being affected by Armor deterioration in Infested Salvage/Jordas Verdict when transferring from Operator to Warframe or when playing as the Client. "},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Update 19.6.0 + 19.6.0.1","date":"2017-01-11T23:47:27Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/748631-the-glast-gambit-update-1960-19601/","additions":"As stated and shown on Devstream #85, the Helminth Cure is here.

When traditional developers pen their open letters at launch, it's often the last step after months or years of development. It's often a sign-off to address the people who are about to dive into the finished work of a collective group. But Warframe is far from traditional and our work is never done.\nThe War Within is here on PC! This is the next chapter in the story of Warframe. What we set out to do always seems a little wild in hindsight, but it's the thrill and ambition of storytelling that drives us to challenge ourselves and you. We want to grow and change Warframe in interesting ways. We're presenting you another chapter of growth today.\nThe War Within is also a reflection of lessons for us on how to feed, respect, and tame the growing animal that is Warframe. This update's name has outgrown itself and it represents something bigger. If you asked any of us 4 years ago what we expected to happen with this project, none of us would believe you if you showed us this day.\nWe are beyond lucky to have hard working people at Digital Extremes to bring this chapter of Warframe to life.

Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Fissure missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive \nThis Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.\nThe Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what’s available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends’ Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!\nA large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren’t craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!\nFixed missing sounds from many various Warframe idle animations.\nFixed seeing incorrect Warframe Deluxe skins on players who switch Warframe's in the Relay.\nFixed the Tethra's Doom badge clipping through Warframe shoulders.\nFixed the Daikyu quiver clipping into the back of numerous Warframes.\nFixed the FX of Nezha’s Warding Halo applying to nearby allies.\nFixed offsets for Lunaro Riv Set chest armour pieces for several Warframes.\nFixed an issue with Steam Big Pic gamepad bindings being wiped if Warframe was launched outside of Big Pic mode."},{"name":"Hotfix: Lunaro 7 + 7.1","date":"2016-06-29T20:32:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/665427-hotfix-lunaro-7-71/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed female Grineer Wardens and Eximus’ using male voices."},{"name":"Hotfix: Lunaro 5","date":"2016-06-23T21:11:41Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/663562-hotfix-lunaro-5/","additions":"","changes":"Improved the direction in which your Warframe will perform a dodge roll.","fixes":""},{"name":"Update: Lunaro","date":"2016-06-15T23:58:19Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/660347-update-lunaro/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"•    Fixed Zephyr’s Turbulence not deflecting bullets from hitscan weapons while in mid-air as per https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4nsj44/bug_turbulence_hitscan_inconsistency_source_found/.\n•    Fixed Hydroid’s abilities causing a delay when attempting to melee or cast another power as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/655371-anyone-notice-the-hydroid-nerf/•    Fixed Valkyr’s Hysteria draining twice the amount of Energy as per:  Fixed Valkyr's Hysteria applying efficiency Mods twice as per: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4nh5fs/fyi_hysteria_energy_drain_mechanics/"},{"name":"Hotfix 18.13.2","date":"2016-06-01T22:37:51Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/655270-hotfix-18132/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"learning to master many Warframes and Weapons in your Arsenal.
